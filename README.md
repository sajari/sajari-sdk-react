# Sajari React SDK

The Sajari React SDK is broken into 3 separate packages:

- `@sajari/react-components` - Core components that allow you to build a beautiful search interface with any back end.
- `@sajari/react-hooks` - Hooks that allow you to build a search interface using any component library.
- `@sajari/react-search-ui` - Easy to use search components to quickly build a beautiful search interface. If you've used previous versions of our SDK, you'll be most familiar with this package.

**Please note:** This version is currently in _beta_. There will be bugs to fix and improvements to be made. Please contact us if you have feedback.
